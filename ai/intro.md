Are you feeling a little bewildered by everything happening right now in the world of AI? When I talk to business colleagues about their opinions and/or plans for AI, and in particular Generative AI systems (for example: LLMs such as ChatGPT and image generators such as Dall-E and Midjourney), I often hear the following:

* It’s all moving so fast, I’m not sure what’s current, what’s in use, and what’s coming.
* It feels useful and powerful, but I’m not sure how it applies to my area, or how I should be approaching it.
* I'm not sure where to start, or what to ask.

These are all very reasonable ways to feel at this juncture.

* AI is moving extraordinarily quickly, so fast even experts need to spend significant time keeping current on new developments.
* Many companies are experimenting a variety of applications, but almost no one yet has “transformed their business” yet, as the evangelists promise.
* There are hundreds of startups; almost all are very early stages of providing truly useful end-solutions and creating value.

It is entirely reasonable, given the current state of play, to feel overwhelmed, not sure where to start, and indeed not sure what level of investment of time is worthwhile at this point. Formulating questions takes time and effort, which are precious commodities. 

However, every business person, at this point, needs to get a toe-hold in AI concepts. Whether you plan to be at the leading edge or following the pack, the fast pace of progress in AI means it makes sense to keep yourself in a **state of readiness**. 

If you don’t have the questions yet, or your basic question is the three-word question in the title of this guide, then read on. If you think you have the questions, you might find this guide answers some of them, too. My goals are as follows:

* To get you started and make you knowledgeable about AI from a business perspective.
* To allow you to dig into the areas that interest you and you believe are relevant to your area.
* To solicit questions, which you should feel free to ask. 

I’m going to present the topics in an order that makes sense to me and allows you to build on what you read, but some of this information you may find basic or less interesting, so feel free to jump around. I’ll try to link internally so that’s easier, and to external resources for further reading if you’re interested.

Again, this is not exactly an FAQ, it’s the other thing. But I’ve put it into a Q and A format – let’s see if that works! Without further ado, let’s get started.
