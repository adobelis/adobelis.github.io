The world of AI is a little bewildering right now. 

* It’s all moving so fast, it is hard to know what’s current, what’s in use, and what’s coming.
* It feels useful and powerful, but it's hard to know what applies to your area, or how to approach it.
* Given all of the above, it is hard to know where to start.

Things are indeed moving **very** fast, and many companies are experimenting a variety of applications, 
but the promised “business transformation" is still to come.
There are hundreds of startups; almost all are very early stages of providing truly useful end-solutions and creating value. 
It is entirely reasonable, given the current state of play, to feel overwhelmed, not sure where to start, and indeed not sure what level of investment of time is worthwhile at this point. 
Formulating questions takes time and effort, which are precious commodities.

However, every businessperson, at this point, needs to get a toe-hold in AI concepts. Whether you plan to be at the leading edge or following the pack, the fast pace of progress in AI means it makes sense to keep yourself in a **state of readiness**. 

If you don’t have the questions yet, or your basic question is let's say "WTH?", then read on. If you think you have the questions, you might find this guide answers some of them, too. My goals are as follows:

* To get you started and make you knowledgeable about AI from a business perspective.
* To allow you to dig into the areas that interest you and you believe are relevant to your area.
* To solicit questions, which you should feel free to ask. 

I’m going to present the topics in an order that makes sense to me and allows you to build on what you read, but some of this information you may find basic or less interesting, so feel free to jump around. I’ll try to link internally so that’s easier, and to external resources for further reading if you’re interested.

Again, this is not exactly an FAQ, it’s the other thing. But I’ve put it into a Q and A format – let’s see if that works! Without further ado, let’s get started.
